    <P> My name is yarien perez and I was born in Bronx, NY. 
        I lived in New York for about 5 years before moving here to RI with my family.
        At  the age of 6 or 7 I was introduced to video games where I played my first 
        ps2 game called Jak and Daxter the Precurser Legacy. This is my favorite childhood 
        game because I enjoyed the story when I was young and I loved to adventure through 
        the levels. Fast forward to the present I'm 18 I love video games even more then when 
        I was young and I also love listening to music like Alternative Rock, Alternative Metal, Nu-Metal, Metalcore ect...</p>
